Description:
Story line is more like a portfolio but not in a professional way it combines between the social and professional like you can display the stages of your life with photos in the specific section and also you will be able to share your resume and your professional field you work in and share your knowledge about the field give information based on your study or your work.

how it works
Story line is different than any ordinary portfolio the information that is being displayed not written in the html file but stored in a database by changing the table of the database with the right names it will display different information about anyone so it valid for anyone to use with minimum effort to change the information and this will be in a future work

the pages that story line contains
Story line contains five pages every page specializes in displaying specific information. First one is home page contain the image of the person and brief of him with most significant skills he has in the bottom the second one is called about this will display the most of your life stages interesting the third one for the college stage you can share your moments there with images and text with it. The fourth called skills in fact it is a button but when you click on it will display your resume you can upload your resume on your drive and get the link to inject it in the button and make sure to make your resume public in order to be accessible. The fifth it will display your knowledge about your field with images if there.

building stage data base and flask
First, I have built the data base with my information and called it informatoins.db and it contains a table called information with four column (id, name, description, link). then I used flask with four routes (/, /about, /education, /aerospace) and import SQL from CS50 library I tried to use SQL Alchemy on my VS.Code but the commands weren’t in SQL language which I have learnt during the course of CS50 and I’m familiar with so I decided to use CS50.dev because it will make things easier. I also import the following functions from flask library (render_template, redirect, url_for) I was planning to use url_for and redirect but I didn’t find anything suitable for them to use. Then I have accessed every piece of information stored in the data base and stored it in a variable to pass it to the html file to render it.

template files
First, I made and html file called base.html this is the one will be inherited from the other files it contains the link of the bootstrap library and the link of the CSS file and the include command for nav bar and also for footer I put the nav bar and footer in separated files from base.html in order to make it easier to change them if we want, I put the right route for every button in the nav bar but when it comes to the footer it is a different story when I took the footer from bootstrap example it didn’t render with logos of Facebook and Instagram so I had to get the logos with myself but I have changed the logo of Instagram with LinkedIn it is better and a inject the logos with right links for Facebook and LinkedIn for my accounts there. Now will talk about the main html files which is (home.html, about.html, education.html, aerospace.html) only the home.html file is different from the others because it is not follow the pattern of the other files it contain a circle image of me beside the wind tunnel in my college with a brief of me and some significant skills in the bottom this page it is the same page of my home page assignment in week8 with button link in the end of the brief to get you to the about page to read my stages of life the rest of the three pages follow the pattern with image as cover photo and heading beneath it except for about.html doesn’t have cover photo because I didn’t find a suitable one, followed by the sections that will be displayed. The text of the section on the left and the image on the right in order to express about the text.

future work
We can develop this into something in the future we can make sign up for account for anybody and will submit a form contain everything that he wants to share it on the webpage beside the images links all of his information will be stored in the database and he will have a webpage of his own.
